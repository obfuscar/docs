Configuration
=============

Obfuscar accepts a single command line argument: the path to its configuration
file.

The configuration file is used to specify what assemblies should be obfuscated,
where to find the dependencies for the assemblies, and where the obfuscated
assemblies should be saved.

The configuration file is an XML file with top-level element ``Obfuscator``.

Settings
--------

Variables are typically used to store settings. Recommended variable names to use are:

=================== ===========================================================
Name                Description
=================== ===========================================================
InPath              Directory containing the input assemblies, such as ``c:\\in``.
OutPath             Directory to contain the obfuscated assemblies, such as ``c:\\out``.
LogFile             Obfuscation log file path (mapping.txt).
XmlMapping          Whether the log file should be of XML format.
KeyFile             Key file path, such as ``c:\folder\key.pfx``.
KeyContainer        Key container name.
RegenerateDebugInfo Whether to generate debug symbols for obfuscated assemblies.
MarkedOnly          Whether to only obfuscate marked items. All items are obfuscated when set to ``false``.
RenameProperties    Whether to rename properties.
KeepProperties      Whether to keep properties from removal.
RenameEvents        Whether to rename events.
RenameFields        Whether to rename fields.

ReuseNames          Whether to reuse obfuscated names.
UseUnicodeNames     Whether to use Unicode characters as obfuscated names.
UseKoreanNames      Whether to use Korean characters as obfuscated names.
HideStrings         Whether to hide strings.
OptimizeMethods     Whether to optimize methods.
SuppressIldasm      Whether to include an attribute for ILDASM to indicate that assemblies are obfuscated.
AnalyzeXaml         Whether to analyze XAML related metadata for obfuscation.
SkipGenerated       Whether to skip certain types marked with compiler-generated attributes during obfuscation.
=================== ===========================================================

The default values can be found in `source code <https://github.com/obfuscar/obfuscar/blob/2.2.41/Obfuscar/Settings.cs>`_ .

Variables, InPath and OutPath
-----------------------------
The following is an example of a minimal configuration. It is provided in
the source code as part of the Basic Example:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version='1.0'?>
   <Obfuscator>
     <Var name="InPath" value=".\Obfuscator_Input" />
     <Var name="OutPath" value=".\Obfuscator_Output" />

     <Module file="$(InPath)\BasicExampleExe.exe" />
     <Module file="$(InPath)\BasicExampleLibrary.dll" />
   </Obfuscator>

In this sample, the two variables InPath and Output are defined
using the ``Var`` element. The sample also specifies that two assemblies should be obfuscated: an
executable and a dll.

Variables defined using the ``Var`` element will be expanded in strings following
the definition. For example, when InPath is defined as:

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="InPath" value=".\Obfuscator_Input" />

it can be used in a module:

.. code-block:: xml

   <Module file="$(InPath)\BasicExampleExe.exe" />

A few special variables have additional effects:

- The variable ``InPath`` is used when resolving dependencies by searching the specified path. The default of ``InPath`` is the current working directory (".").
- The variable ``OutPath`` is used as the output path for the obfuscated assemblies and the log file specified in the variable ``LogFile``. The default of ``OutPath`` is the current working directory (".").

Assembly Search Path (2.2.5+)
-----------------------------
This setting specifies one additional directory to search for referenced assemblies. There can
be multiple instances of this setting, which are searched sequentially.

.. code-block:: xml

   <AssemblySearchPath path=".\Library\UnityAssemblies" />
   <AssemblySearchPath path=".\Assets\SpriteSharp\Editor\3rdParty" />

KeepPublicApi and HidePrivateApi
--------------------------------
A common case of assembly obfuscation is to obfuscate the names of private types and type members and
keep public items. You can achieve this by:

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="KeepPublicApi" value="true" />
   <Var name="HidePrivateApi" value="true" />

.. note:: By using above you don't need to set any obfuscation attribute or
   rule.

This is the default behavior since version 2.2.0.

Another common case is to obfuscate all types and type members, which you can achieve using

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="KeepPublicApi" value="false" />
   <Var name="HidePrivateApi" value="true" />

Of course to obfuscate nothing you can use

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="KeepPublicApi" value="true" />
   <Var name="HidePrivateApi" value="false" />

The last combination obfuscates solely public types and type members:

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="KeepPublicApi" value="false" />
   <Var name="HidePrivateApi" value="false" />

It has little practical use, but was the default setting for version 2.1.*.

Modules
-------
The assemblies to be obfuscated are listed one-by-one as a separate ``Module`` element. 
Assemblies
referenced by an assembly specified by a ``Module`` element must be resolvable,
either via Cecil's regular resolution process, via the
path specified by InPath or via a directory listed as ``AssemblySearchPath``.

Only assemblies specified in a ``Module`` element will be obfuscated. Resolved
assemblies are not altered.

It is highly recommended that you list assemblies one by one, and you can write simple PowerShell scripts
to iterate files in the folder and generate a list of ``Module`` tags.

.. note:: A more complex way of specifying assemblies with ``Modules`` element were
   added by Thomas Caudal. You can refer to `this pull request <https://github.com/obfuscar/obfuscar/pull/254#issuecomment-581113846>`_. 

Exclusion Rules by Configuration
--------------------------------
It is possible to include additional elements within the Module elements to
skip types (the ``SkipTypes`` element), methods (the ``SkipMethod`` element), fields
(``SkipField``), properties (``SkipProperty``), and events (``SkipEvent``, of course).
Methods can be excluded from string obfuscation by ``SkipStringHiding``. Special
types such as enumerations can be excluded by ``SkipEnums``.

The ``SkipNamespace`` element specifies a namespace that should be skipped. All
types, methods, fields, etc., within the namespace will be skipped.

The ``SkipType`` element specifies the name of the type to skip, including the
full namespace. It can also specify whether to skip the method, fields,
properties, and/or events within the type.

The ``SkipMethod`` element specifies the name of the type containing the method,
a protection specifier, and a name or regex to match the method. The
protection specifier is currently ignored, but will eventually be used for
additional filtering.

The ``SkipField`` element specifies the name of the type containing the field, a
protection specifier, and a name or regex to match the field. The protection
specifier is currently ignored, but will eventually be used for additional
filtering.

The ``SkipProperty`` element specifies the name of the type containing the
property, a protection specifier, and a name or regex to match the property.
The protection specifier is currently ignored, but will eventually be used for
additional filtering.

The ``SkipEvent`` element specifies the name of the type containing the event, a
protection specifier, and a name or regex to match the event. The protection
specifier is currently ignored, but will eventually be used for additional
filtering.

The ``SkipStringHiding`` element works like the ``SkipMethod`` element, but specifies
within which methods not to obfuscate the string constants. To make it harder
to analyze the code, Obfuscar normally replaces string loads by method calls
to lookup functions, which incurs a small performance penalty.

A more complete example:

.. code-block:: xml

   <Module file="$(InPath)\AssemblyX.exe">
     <!-- skip a namespace -->
     <SkipNamespace name="Company.PublicBits" />

     <!-- to skip a namespace recursively, just put * on the end -->
     <SkipNamespace name="Company.PublicBits*" />

     <!-- skip field by name -->
     <SkipField type="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName"
       attrib="public" name="Fieldname" />

     <!-- skip field by regex -->
     <SkipField type="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName"
       attrib="public" rx="Pub.*" />

     <!-- skip type...will still obfuscate its methods -->
     <SkipType name="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName2" />

     <!-- skip type...will skip its methods next -->
     <SkipType name="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName3" />
     <!-- skip TypeName3's public methods -->
     <SkipMethod type="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName3"
       attrib="public" rx=".*" />
     <!-- skip TypeName3's protected methods -->
     <SkipMethod type="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName3"
       attrib="family" rx=".*" />

     <!-- skip type and its methods -->
     <SkipType name="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName4" skipMethods="true" />
     <!-- skip type and its fields -->
     <SkipType name="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName4" skipFields="true" />
     <!-- skip type and its properties -->
     <SkipType name="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName4" skipProperties="true" />
     <!-- skip type and its events -->
     <SkipType name="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName4" skipEvents="true" />
     <!-- skip attributes can be combined (this will skip the methods and fields) -->
     <SkipType name="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName4" skipMethods="true" skipFields="true" />
     <!-- skip the hiding of strings in this type's methods -->
     <SkipType name="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName4" skipStringHiding="true" />

     <!-- skip a property in TypeName5 by name -->
     <SkipProperty type="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName5"
       name="Property2" />
     <!-- skip a property in TypeName5 by regex -->
     <SkipProperty type="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName5"
       attrib="public" rx="Something\d" />

     <!-- skip an event in TypeName5 by name -->
     <SkipProperty type="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName5"
       name="Event2" />
     <!-- skip an event in TypeName5 by regex -->
     <SkipProperty type="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName5"
       rx="Any.*" />

     <!-- avoid the hiding of strings in TypeName6 on all methods -->
     <SkipStringHiding type="Full.Namespace.And.TypeName6" name="*" />
   </Module>

To prevent all properties from being obfuscated, set the RenameProperties
variable to "false" (it's an xsd boolean). To prevent specific properties
from being renamed, use the ``SkipProperty`` element. It will also skip the
property's accessors, get_XXX and set_XXX.

To prevent all events from being obfuscated, set the RenameEvents variable to
"false" (it's also xsd boolean). To prevent specific events from being
renamed, use the ``SkipEvent`` element. It will also skip the event's accessors,
add_XXX and remove_XXX.

Inclusion Rules by Configuration (new)
--------------------------------------
To supplement ``Skip*`` elements, ``Force*`` has been added.

Name Matching
-------------
The ``SkipMethod``, ``SkipProperty``, ``SkipEvent``, ``SkipField``, and ``SkipStringHiding``
elements accept an rx attribute that specifies a regular expression used to
match the name of the thing to be skipped. The ``SkipType``, ``SkipMethod``,
``SkipProperty``, ``SkipEvent``, ``SkipField``, and ``SkipStringHiding`` elements all accept a
name attribute that specifies a string with optional wildcards or a regular
expression used to match the name of the thing to be skipped. For elements
where both the name and rx attributes are specified, the rx attribute is
ignored.

The name attribute can specify either a string or a regular expression to
match the name of the thing to be skipped. If the value of the name attribute
begins with a '^' character, the value (including the '^') will be treated as
a regular expression (e.g., the name '^so.*g' will match the string
something). Otherwise, the value will be used as a wildcard string, where '*'
matches zero or more characters, and '?' matches a single character (e.g., the
wildcard string som?t*g will match the string something).

This behavior also applies to the value of the type attribute of the
``SkipMethod``, ``SkipProperty``, ``SkipEvent``, ``SkipField``, and ``SkipStringHiding`` elements.

Accessibility Check
-------------------
The ``SkipMethod``, ``SkipProperty``, ``SkipEvent``, ``SkipField``, and ``SkipStringHiding``
elements also accept an attrib attribute.

* Not specified or ``attrib=''``: All members are skipped from obfuscation.
* ``attrib='public'``: Only public members are skipped.
* ``attrib='protected'``: Only public and protected members are skipped.
* All other values for attrib generate an error by now.

Members which are internal or protected internal are not skipped when attrib
is public or protected.

Properties and events do not directly have an accessibility attribute, but
their underlying methods (getter, setter, add, remove) have. For properties
the attribute of the getter and for events the attribute of the add method is
used.

Exclusion by Attributes in Code
-------------------------------
There's also some functionality where you can mark types with an attribute to
prevent them from being obfuscated.

`System.Reflection.ObfuscationAttribute <https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.reflection.obfuscationattribute>`_

.. note:: The Obfuscar attribute defined in Obfuscar itself is obsolete.

And if you only want specific classes obfuscated, you can set the ``MarkedOnly``
variable to ``true`` (also an xsd boolean), and apply the ``ObfuscationAttribute``
to the things you want obfuscated. This is done in the ``ObfuscarTests`` project
(included w/ the source...it's intended to be a place for unit tests, but for
now does little) to obfuscate a subset of the classes. For example, if
``MarkedOnly`` is set to true, to include obfuscation of X, its methods, fields,
resources, etc.

Inclusion/Exclusion Rule Priorities
-----------------------------------
Above several inclusion/exclusion methods have been documented. What if
multiple rules apply to a single item? Which rule is executed while others
ignored?

The rule of thumb is as below,

#. Attributes set on the item is always of top priority. If an attribute is
   detected, then all other rules are ignored. For members of a type, if the
   member itself does not contain such attributes, the type's attributes take
   effect.
#. If no attribute is set, inclusion rules (``Force*``) are of top priority.
#. If no inclusion rule is set, exclusion rules (``Skip*``) are of top priority.
#. If no exclusion rule is set, ``KeepPublicApi`` and ``HidePrivateApi`` take effect.

Control Generation of Obfuscated Names
--------------------------------------
By default all new type and member names generated by Obfuscar are only unique
within their scopes. A type with name A may be part of namespace A.A and A.B.
The same holds true for type members. Multiple types may have fields and
properties with the same name.

When using ``System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer`` on obfuscated types, the
names of generated Xml elements and attributes have to be specified with one
of the ``XmlXXXXXAttribute`` attributes. This is because the original type and
member names do not exist any more after obfuscation. For some reasons the
``XmlSerializer`` uses the obfuscated names internally even though they are
overridden by attributes. Because of that it fails on duplicate names. The
same is true for the XML Serializer Generator Tool (Sgen.exe).

You can work around this problem by setting the ReuseNames variable to false.
In this case the obfuscator does not reuse names for types, fields and
properties. The generated names are unique over all assemblies. This setting
does not apply to methods.

Add the following line to the configuration file to enable unique names:

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="ReuseNames" value="false" />

You can use ``UseUnicodeNames`` and ``UseKoreanNames`` to further control the
characters used in obfuscated names. Unicode characters are often not readable,
while Korean characters look almost the same to most audience. They provide
good alternatives if you think the default characters do not provide the
strongest obfuscation.

Control String Hiding
---------------------
By default Obfuscar hides all string constants by replacing the string load
(``LDSTR`` opcode) by calls to methods which return the string from a buffer. This
buffer is allocated on startup (in a static constructor) by reading from a
XOR-encoded UTF8 byte array containing all strings. This comes with a small
performance cost. You can disable this feature completely by adding the
following line to the configuration file:

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="HideStrings" value="false" />

If you only want to disable it on specific methods, use the SkipStringHiding
elements.

.. important:: This feature hides the strings in a reversible way so that your
   code can remain valid, which means a de-obfuscation tool can reverse the
   string contents easily. Therefore, never store confidential information as
   strings in your assemblies, because this feature won't protect them from
   being read.

SuppressIldasm Attribute
------------------------
Microsoft designed an attribute ``SuppressIldasmAttribute``, which if set on an
.NET assembly can indicate that ILDASM utility from Microsoft should not
display IL of the assembly.

.. important:: Obfuscar inserts this attribute if you enable this feature.
   However, decompilers (ILSpy, .NET Reflector, JustDecompile, or dotPeek) do
   not honor this attribute at all. Thus, practically speaking, it is a useless
   feature designed by Microsoft.

Signing of Strongly Named Assemblies
------------------------------------
Signed assemblies will not work after obfuscation and must be re-signed.

Add the following line to the configuration file to specify the path to your
key file. When given a KeyFile in the configuration, Obfuscar will sign a
previously signed assembly with the given key. Relative paths are searched
from the current directory and, if not found, from the directory containing
the particular assembly.

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="KeyFile" value="key.snk" />

If the project uses a .pfx file to sign the assembly, by default Visual Studio
would create a key container in Windows, whose name can be found from MSBuild
diagnostic logging.

.. note:: Once MSBuild diagnostic logging is enabled via ``/v:diag`` switch,
   the key container name can be found by searching for
   ``KeyContainerName=VS_KEY_XXXXXX`` in the output.

The key container name can then be used in Obfuscar configuration,

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="KeyContainer" value="VS_KEY_XXXXXX" />

.. important:: `KeyContainer` setting is supported in release 2.2.13 and above.

If neither KeyFile nor KeyContainer is specified, Obfuscar normally throws an
exception on signed assemblies. If an assembly is marked delay signed, the
signing step will be skipped in case no key file is given.

.. note:: With the special key file name auto, Obfuscar uses the value of the
   AssemblyKeyFileAttribute instead (if existing).

Configuration Fragments (2.2.5+)
--------------------------------
Configuration can now be split into multiple files.

Usage example:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <Obfuscator>
     <Var name="InPath" value="..\..\Input" />
     <Var name="OutPath" value="..\..\Output" />
     <Var name="KeepPublicApi" value="false" />
     <Var name="HidePrivateApi" value="true" />
     <Include path="$(InPath)\TestInclude.xml" />
     <Module file="$(InPath)\AssemblyWithCustomAttr.dll">
         <Include path="$(InPath)\TestIncludeModule.xml" />
     </Module>
   </Obfuscator>

TestInclude.xml:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version='1.0'?>
   <Include>
     <Var name='TestIncludeVar' value='Foo' />
   </Include>

TestIncludeModule.xml:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version='1.0'?>
   <Include>
     <SkipMethod type='SkipVirtualMethodTest.Interface1' name='Method1' />
   </Include>

SkipGenerated
--------------
This setting instructs Obfuscar to skip obfuscation of types that have compiler-generated attributes. When set to ``true``, any type marked with both attributes of ``[CompilerGenerated]`` and ``[Embedded]`` attributes will be excluded from obfuscation.

This is particularly useful when working with assemblies that contain compiler-generated code to support latest C# language features, where obfuscating these types might cause runtime issues or decompilation issues.

.. code-block:: xml

   <Var name="SkipGenerated" value="true" />

By default, this setting is ``false``, meaning such compiler-generated types are included in obfuscation.

If you cannot use this setting, you can also use the ``SkipType`` element to exclude specific types from obfuscation.

.. note:: This setting is only available in Obfuscar version 2.2.48 and later.
